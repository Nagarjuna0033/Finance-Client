## Add New Due Number Page

The Add New Due Number Page is designed for admin use only. This page allows administrators to manually assign amounts paid by individuals with invalid or missing student IDs to the correct students. This ensures that any misplaced payments are properly recorded in the system.

### Key Features:
- **Admin-Only Access**: 
  - This page is accessible exclusively to the Director and Finance Office Head, ensuring secure and authorized updates.

- **Add/Update Due Number**:
  - If a payment was made by a person whose ID does not exist in the system, admins can enter the correct details to associate the payment with the right student.
  - Required fields for updating a due number:
    - **Amount Paid**
    - **Due Number**
    - **Date of Payment**
    - **Proof of Payment** (such as a director's signature or other verification documents)
