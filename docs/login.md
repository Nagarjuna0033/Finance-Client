## Login Page

The Login Page provides secure access for admins, specifically for the Director and the Finance Office Head. This page allows only these two roles to log in and edit details, while other users are restricted from making modifications.

### Key Features:
- **Single Login for Admins**: Both the Director and Finance Office Head can log in using the same page.
- **User Authentication**: Ensures that only authorized personnel (Director and Finance Office Head) can access and modify sensitive information.
- **Role-Based Access**: Only the Director and Finance Office Head have permissions to edit details; other users have read-only access.

### Design Elements:
- Simple and user-friendly interface for quick login.
- Input fields for username and password.
